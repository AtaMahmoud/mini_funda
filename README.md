# mini_funda

Just a mini version of Funda's overview screen using Funda API

## Development
Mini Funda is built with `VS Code`, `Flutter 3.16.0` and `Dart 3.2.0`

The app follows `bloc` state management library which allows us to separate our application into three layers:

* Presentation which is the app UI.
* Business Logic where all `Blocs` orchestrate the flow of data and UI interactions.
* Data layer which includes the API client and repository.



## Getting Started

Get third-party packages:

```sh

```

to run all test files

```
the app includes a mix of normal tests and widget tests.
